# QuacsWatcher

A Python script that checks if your desired RPI courses have open spots on SIS. 

Piggybacks off https://github.com/quacs/quacs-data SIS scraping for course data.

My end goal is to create a notification system for any open spaces in desired classes. In the future, I'd like to try making the output more descriptive, adding an import function based off the Quacs schedule export function, and integrating it into a website or Discord bot.
