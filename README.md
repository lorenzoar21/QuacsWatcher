# QuacsWatcher

A Python script that checks if your desired RPI courses have open spots on SIS. 

Piggybacks off https://github.com/quacs/quacs-data SIS scraping for course data.

In the future, I'd like to try making the output more descriptive, or possibly integrating it into a website or Discord bot.
